        This happened a week ago early hours on Saturday.<br>I was quite angry with the delay and the robotic<br> responses from your executives. However the way<br> your senior escalation team member , I guess her<br> name was maumita handled my concern in the most <br>humane way possible made up for everything. The <br>genuine responses from your valuable team member <br>not only  helped my predicament but also gave me a <br> sense of comfort with swiggy. Nurture her as a great <br>addition to your brand.

        The best food delivery service out there in my <br>personal experience. Even when there is a problem <br> occasionally with late delivery or food getting <br>spilled, they give me a full refund.The best part <br>is that their delivery staff seems to be well trained <br>to not annoy the customers with phone calls and <br>actually use the GPS. A concept zomato guys <br>don't understand

        Surprised about all the bad reviews here. I've <br>ordered like 300 times from them and their <br>service is excellent 95/100 times. Also, whenever <br>there's a occasional mishap, they make sure they <br>compensate the customer for it.
